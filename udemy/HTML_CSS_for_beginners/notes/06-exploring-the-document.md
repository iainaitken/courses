# Exploring the Document

## Notes

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="="en>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>
```

DOCTYPE shows us that this is an HTML 5 document.

All of the html in the page is contained in the html tags.

We specify the language is English so that the browser knows what language to format it in.

The document has a "non-visual" part, i.e. the head. Here, we are telling the browser to do things. For example, to use the UTF-8 character encoding, and the page title.

The body tags contain all of the stuff you'll see on the webpage.
