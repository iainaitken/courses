# Headings

## Notes

The heading tag allows us to mark certain text as a heading, which means it will be in bold and, depending on the level of heading, it will be a certain size:

```html
<h1>Heading for your info</h1>

<h2>Heading for your info</h2>

<h3>Heading for your info</h3>

<h4>Heading for your info</h4>

<h5>Heading for your info</h5>

<h6>Heading for your info</h6>
```
