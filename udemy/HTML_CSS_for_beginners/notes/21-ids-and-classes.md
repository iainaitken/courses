# IDs and Classes

## Notes

Using html tags as the basis for styling can be quite limited - it applies to _all_ elements with that tag, and we cannot target anything specific within the tag.

We can give an individual element in the html document an id attribute. IDs are unique; we can target multiple elements using the class attribute instead.

```css
#first-para {
  color:red;
}

.first-class {
  font-weight:bold;
  color:purple;
}
```
