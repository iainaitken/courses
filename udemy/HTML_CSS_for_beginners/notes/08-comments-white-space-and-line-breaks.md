# Comments, White Space and Line Breaks

## Notes

White space is ignored in html.

We can create white space with a "br" tag.

Comments are indicated with a "!--" tag and can be single- or multi-lined.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="="en>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Universal</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a sentence.</p>





    <p>This is another sentence, with no white space between this and the first sentence.</p>

    <br>

    <p>This is a sentence following a line break tag.</p>

    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <!-- 
      This too is a comment 
    -->
  </body>
</html>
```
