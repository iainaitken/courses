## Notes

Links allow us to do a number of things, such as open other pages or open JavaScript functions. They let us see images in a different page.

Links are incorporated with an anchor tag ("a"). This has an opening and closing tag, but usually the link text will be on one line, if it is a simple link.

The URL is contained in an attribute of the tag.

Another attribute is "target". This allows us to tell the browser _where_ we want the link to be opened. For example, "_blank" will direct the browser to open the link in a new tab.

```html

    <title>Links</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a href="10-creating-images.html" target="_blank">CLICK ME</a>
