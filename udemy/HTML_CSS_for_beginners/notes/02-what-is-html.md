# What is HTML

## Notes

HyperText Markup Language is not a programming language, it is a markup language.

Used to create the structure of webpages.

HTML tags form the basis of HTML:

```html
<p> This is a paragraph tag </p>
```

Most HTML have closing tags, but some don't, such as:

```html
<hr> (horizontal rule)
<br> (break)
```

<head> is the non-visual part of the page.
<body> is the visual part of the page.

HTML is saved in html files.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

Used to control how a page looks.

Start with a selector - below, we are selecting any HTML tag with a p in it, and changing the text colour to red and the weight to bold:

```css
p {
  color:red;
  font-weight:bold;
  }
```

File must be saved with a .css extension.
