# Iteration: the for Loop

## Notes

Loops are a form of control structure.

Loops are fundamental to programming - they allow us to automate repetitive tasks and keep our code DRY.

One form of loop is the for loop. We create a condition, and the loop will keep running as long as the condition is true.

```javascript
for(let rep = 1; rep <= 10; rep++) {
  console.log(`lifting weights repetition ${rep}`);
}
```
