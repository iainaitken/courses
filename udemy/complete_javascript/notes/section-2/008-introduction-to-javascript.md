## Notes

JavaScript is a __High-Level__, __Object-Oriented__, __Multi-Paradigm__ Programming Language.

__High-Level__ = High level of abstraction - we don't have to worry about things like memory management (think back to C).

__Object-oriented__ = based around the concept of using objects to store data

__Multi-paradigm__ = we can use different styles of programming, such as imperative and declarative.

### Role of JavaScript in Web Development

There are three core technologies of the web:

1. HTML - responsible for content of page
2. CSS - responsible for styling/presentation of content
3. JS - responsible for adding dynamic and interactive effects, and create web applications

These three technologies work together to create websites. A helpful analogy is:

HTML - nouns

CSS - adjectives

JS - verbs

JS allows us to add effects and build entire web applications in the browser. These applications feel like the apps we use on computers and phones. JS made the modern web possible.

There are many JS frameworks and libraries that make modern web apps easier and faster, such as React, Angular etc.

JS can run outside of web browsers. For example, we can use JS as a web server, using Node.js. This allows us to create back-end applications - applications that interact with databases, web servers etc.

Finally, we can use JS to create native applications for mobile and desktop computers, using React Native, or Ionic.

There are a number of different releases, or versions, of JavaScript, prefixed with "ES" (which stands for ECMAScript).

ES2015 (called ES6 by most) is the first "modern" JS language, and has been followed by annual updates (i.e. ES2016/ES7, ES2017/ES8 etc). Modern JavaScript is very different to older JavaScript.
