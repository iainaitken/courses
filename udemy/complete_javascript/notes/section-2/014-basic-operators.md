# Basic Operators

## Notes

An operator allows us to transform values, or combine values. Basically they let us do all sorts of work with values.

There are different types of operators, such as mathematical, logical, comparison, assignment operators and many more.

### Arithmetic/Mathematical operators

These include:

* plus (+)
* minus (-)
* multiply (*)
* divide (/)
* exponention (**)

The plus operator can be used to concatenate strings.

```javascript
const currentYear = 2021

const ageIain = currentYear - 1980;
const ageSarah = currentYear - 1985;

console.log(ageIain, ageSarah);

console.log(ageIain * 2, ageIain / 10);

console.log(2 ** 5);

const firstName = "Iain";
const lastName = "Aitken";

console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);
```

### Assignment Operators

The most straightforward assignment operator is the equals sign (=). Others include:

* +=
* -=
* *=
* ++
* --

### Comparison Operators

We use comparison operators to produce Boolean values. These include:

* ">"
* <
* ">="
* <=
* ==
* ===

The output of a comparison will either be true or false.
