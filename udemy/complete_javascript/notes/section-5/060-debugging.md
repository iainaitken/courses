# Debugging

## Notes

Debugging is an extremely important developer skill.

A bug is a defect or problem in a computer program; any unexpected behaviour is called a bug.

Bugs are a normal part of software development.

Debugging is the process of finding, fixing and preventing bugs.

1. Identify/discover the bug. This might happen in:
   a. During development.
   b. During testing.
   c. User reports when the software is in production.
2. Find the bug.
   a. Use the developer console (simple code).
   b. Use a debugging tool (complex code).
3. Fix the bug - replace the wrong solution with a new correct solution.
4. Prevent the bug from happening again.
   a. Searching for the same bug in the code.
   b. Use testing software.
