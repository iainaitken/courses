# Setting Up Prettier and VS Code

## Notes

- Use Prettier, which is an opinionated code formatter.
  - Need to select it as default and ensure the "format on save" feature is enabled.
- Check the [docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) for information on changing default settings
- Can change settings for a particular project by creating a .prettierrc file in the project folder, and by adding default settings as follows:

```
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "arrowParens": "avoid"
}
```

- Use code snippets! Consider using a global snippets file.

- TODO Highlight - highlight annotations within your code. Amend the highlighting in settings (click on the icon in the top right, "open settings JSON").
