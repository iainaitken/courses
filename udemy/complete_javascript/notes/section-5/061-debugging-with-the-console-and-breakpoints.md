# Debugging with the Console and Breakpoints

## Notes

In the Chrome developer tools, select "Sources" and click on the relevant .js file to see the JavaScript code.

In the window, left-click on a line number to add a breakpoint at that line.

A breakpoint pauses the code during execution. We can then execute the code step by step and inspect the different variables etc in the code, to see what is happening.

We can tell Chrome to open up the debugging tool with the following line in our code:

```javascript
debugger;
```
