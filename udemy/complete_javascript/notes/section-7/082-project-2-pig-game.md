# Project 3: Pig Game

## Notes

There are two ways of selecting an element by ID:

```javascript
const score0 = document.querySelector("#score--0");
const score1 = document.getElementById("score--1");
```

The second is faster.

The 'toggle' method on classList will check if an attribute is present and, if so, it will remove it. If it is not present, it will add it.
