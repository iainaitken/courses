# Test-Driven Development

## Notes

Not rspec-specific. It is a development pattern.

* Write your tests first.
* Think about how you will build your program first, and build it incrementally.

The process is red-green-refactor

1. Write a failing test
2. Make it pass by writing the bare minimum code to make it pass
3. Refactor code in such a way that the original tests do not break

Guarantees you have test coverage over the entire codebase.
